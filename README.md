A React-based Pokédex app that fetches Pokémon data from the PokéAPI and dynamically displays it. The app allows users to search for Pokémon by name or ID and see detailed information such as their types, abilities, and stats. The Pokémon's height and weight are also displayed, converted to feet and pounds for easier understanding. The app is styled with a clean, responsive design to ensure a seamless user experience.
